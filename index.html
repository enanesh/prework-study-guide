      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
        <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy
          for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
        <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
        <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card" id="css-section">
      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
        <li>Declarations contain two components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
        <li>Separation of concerns refers to separating code into different files based on use</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li> A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="card" id="git-section">
      <h2>Git</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The default branch is called main and it should be the final, most updated version of the application.</li>
        <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
        <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
        <li>git commit - m "plus message": creates a new commit</li>
        <li>Remember that before pushing any request, we have to be sure that we pull down all the changes in the main
          branch. We use the command : git pull origin main </li>

    <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
        <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
        <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even
          executed at all</li>
        <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data
          that is related in some way.</li>
        <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by
          allowing a single code block to be executed over and over</li>
        <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
        <li>To execute a function, we must call it in our code.</li>
